# Imputation of Nonignorable Missing Data in Surveys Using Auxiliary Margins Via Hot Deck and Sequential Imputation

This repository contains the code for https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04599.

The main functions are in `final_MH.R`, `final_MMH.R`, and `final_hybrid.R`. 

Simulation data are generated in `sim_data.R` and simulation results are visualized in `plot.R`.

See `CPS.R` for the application code.
